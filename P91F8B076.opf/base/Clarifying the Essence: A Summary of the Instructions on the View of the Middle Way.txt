Clarifying the Essence

A Summary of the Instructions on the View of the Middle Way

by Rongtön Sheja Kunrig

Oṃ svasti!

In devotion, I pay homage to, and take refuge in, the guru and supreme deity: grant your blessings,
I pray!

The summary of the instructions on the view on the Middle Way includes advice on 1) decisively
eliminating conceptual elaboration[1] through the view; 2) taking the meaning into experience
through meditation; and 3) bringing about enhancement through action.

Meditation

Taking the meaning into experience through meditation has two aspects: 1) calm abiding (śamatha)
and 2) penetrating insight (vipaśyanā).

Vipaśyanā

The instructions on vipaśyanā themselves are divided into two: 1) meditating on the selflessness
of the individual, and 2) meditating on the selflessness of phenomena.

These two incorporate meditations on 1) outer emptiness, 2) inner emptiness, and 3) the emptiness
of both [outer and inner]. As any attachment to the truth of the two forms of selflessness
must also be eliminated, it is also necessary to meditate on how they both lack true
reality, and so 4) the meditation on the emptiness of emptiness is also taught.

Together, these four forms of meditation on emptiness include all the necessary means of cultivating
the view of emptiness, with nothing lacking. Meditating on the first three forms
of emptiness eliminates imputation[2] regarding phenomena (chos can; dharmin), while meditating
on the emptiness of emptiness eliminates imputation regarding the nature of phenomena
(chos nyid; dharmatā).

As Śāntideva said:

When notions of real and unrealAre absent from before the mind,Then, there is no other possibility,But
to rest in total peace, beyond concepts.[3]

This summary of the instructions on the view of the Middle Way was composed by the great Rongtön
at glorious Nālendra.
